	 > Anything that is running in linux is a process
         EXAMLLES:
		      * Shell that is running and taking our commands
			  * The commands that we type on terminal
      > A Program which is being executed
      >Processes are much like us 
            * They are born.they die 
            * They have parent and children
	  > A Shell can also give birth to another shell process
	          process attributes:
			          PID   :Process ID
					  PPID  :Parent Process ID
			PID:Each process is uniquely identified
                by an unique integer=PID
				
# uptime 
# free :memory information
# free -m :memory information of 
           human reduble formate
# df :Partition information
# vmstat :Utilize and information of different processes
# man vmstat :Discription of fields
      vmstat:virtual memory statistic
	  
*PROCS
     r:the number of processes waiting for run time
	 b:the number of processes in uninterruptible sleep
*MEMORY 
     swpd:amount of virtual memory used
     free:amount of idle memory
     buff:amount of memory used as buffers.
     cache:amount of memory used as cache.
     inact/active:amount of inactive and active memory(-a option)
*SWAP
    si:amount of memory swapped in from disk
    so:amount of memory swapped to disk
*IO
  bi:blocks received from a block device
  bo:blocks sent to a block device
  
 PS Commands:- Is used for listing the current executing processes
      ps -e
	  ps -ef
	  ps -ef
	  ps -ely
	  ps aux
	  ps ax  
	         NOTE: e - To display all the processes
			       f - To display full formate listing
				   
1.To get info about a specific process
    # ps -ef | grep <process name>	
2.List the processes based on PIDs
    # ps -p <process-id>
3.List of process based on UIDs
    # ps -u <process-id>	
	
To print a process tree(Which process is running):-
      # ps -ejH
I can see all the child processes:-	
      # ps -eLf

TOP:-
   Top will display a full screen of information about the processes running
   on the system,as well as some overall information about the system.
   This includes Load average,
                 number of processes,
				 The CPU status,
				 Free memory information,  
   and details about processes including
				 PID,
				 User priority,
				 CPU and Memory Usage information,
				 running time,
				 and program name.

SHIFT+M - List the process according to memory usage
SHIFT+P - List the process according to CPU usage

* Z(press)- List running process is Colour.
* r(press)- For renice a process

Kill :-
    On occasion,programs misbehave and it needs to be killed.
 	    # kill pid
		# pkill <process name> - for killing the process by name
