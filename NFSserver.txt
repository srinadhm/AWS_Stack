NFS server

Steps:-

Important Configuration files:-

 * /etc/exports:-      It is main configuration files
                       Which file systems are exports to remote hosts
				       and specific options.
					   
 * /etc/fstab  :-      This file is used to control what file systems 
                       including NFS directories are mounted when the system boots.
					   
 * /etc/sysconfig/nfs:-This file is used to control which ports the required RPC service run on.

 * /etc/hosts.allow and * /etc/hosts.deny :- This files are called TCP Wrappers,
                                             control the access to NFS server. It is used by
											 NFS to decide whether or not to accept a connection  
											 comming in from another IP address.
Prerequisites for NFS server:-

* YUM should be configured
* SELINUX should be Disabled
* Iptables should be disabled or port 2049 should ne enable
* Connectivity should be enabled between NFS server and Client server 	

Important Services:-

* RPCbind      :The rpcbind server converts RPC program numbers into universel address
* NFS-server   :It enables the client to access NFS shares
* NFS-lock/rpc-statd :NFS file locking.implement file lock recovery when 
                      an NFS server crashes and reboots.
* NFS-idmap    :It translates user and group ids into names,and to translate    
				user and group names into ids
				
Installation of NFS server:-

1.yum install nfs-utills -y
  once the packages are installed,enable and start NFS services
  systemctl enable rpcbind
  systemctl enable nfs-server    
  
  Creating  NFS Share Directory:-
  
      creat a directory and to share with  nfs client server
	  you can also share your existing directory with nfs
	  
	#mkdir /arjun
   #chmod 777 /arjun
#vi /etc/exports : /arjun ip(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
  after run the command
  
   exportfs -v:Display a list of shares files and exports otion on server
   exportfs -a:Exporets all directories listed in /etc/exports
   exportfs -u:Unexports one or more directories
   exportfs -r:Reexports all directories after modifying /etc/exports

*To mount the shares automatically on every reboot,
 need to modify "/etc/fstab" file of your client system
    # open the file with vi editor
   #vi /etc/fstab

Auto mount :-
       
            First we need to install in client
    #yum install autofs* -y
   then we are creating directory
open the file "/etc/auto.master"
