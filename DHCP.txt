DHCP :- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

     * Automatically assigns IP addresses and other network
	   configuration information like(subnetmask, broadcast address,
	   dns server etc)to computers on a network
	   
	 *  DHCP server must have static IP address
	 
Steps:-

1.Install package
     yum install dhcp

2.Check files,type yum -ql dhcp	 
      dhclient.d   -for dhcp client
	  dhcpd.conf   -for IPv4
	  dhcpd6.conf  -for IPv6
	  dhcpd.leases -dhcp server lease file
	  
3.Check dhcp.conf files
   Its empty...no configuration is there but you have simple file
   /user/share/doc/dhcp-4.1.1/dhcpd.conf.sample
   copy sample file to /etc/dhcp/ & give its name to dhcpd.conf


4.Now open /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file
   now uncomment "authoritative"

5.Now enable log file for dhcp server monitoring   open new tab ctl+shift+tab
  edit /etc/rsyslog.conf
  add entry
  local6.*                    /var/log/dhcp.log
  then save 
  
6.Now in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.configuration
  edit in "log-facilitty local7" to "local6"  
  then save
  
7.Now just edit like me ....just fallow me ...and save..
  just disable router option

8.dhcp server start
  chkconfig dhcp on
  chkconfig --list dhcpd  
  
9.Now restart dhcpd service.

10.Now start rsyslog service

11.Now see log file | /var/log/dhcp.log
   file is empty ....now we go to client machine...
   see our dhcp server working fine....:)

12.Find who obtain ip address from our dhcp server
   /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases
